Tip to setup Angular momentum apparatus:
0. Remember how all parts are arranged on the workbench to return them back at the end of lab.
1. Insert bar in the hole on the top of shaft.
2. Hang the bob (rocket shape) by hook on the bar string.
3. Connect spring to bob and vertical shaft.
4. Adjust the bar to align the bob to vertical position when spring is perpendocular the bob
   (ususally somewhere when bob cone end close to the pointer)
5. Secure the bar to shaft by the screw.
6. Insert counter mass (cylinder) on the bar from opposite side from the bob and temporary
   secure it by screw.
7. Tilt slightly the whole apparatus and see if the bar starts to rotate. 
   Notice where the counter mass moving up or down.
8. Release counter mass screw and move the mass closer to bob if mass moved down on previous step
   or awaay from the bob if mass moved down on previous step. Fix the screw.
9. Do several iterations of steps 7 and 8 to reach moderate apparatus balance when
   conunterweight mass is not moving or slowly moving when you tilt apparatus. 
10. Be sure that belt between shaft and motor is not taken off.
11. Tight FIRMLY both bar screws to be sure that counterweight mass will not fly
    off during rotation to the head of the experimentator !!!!s
