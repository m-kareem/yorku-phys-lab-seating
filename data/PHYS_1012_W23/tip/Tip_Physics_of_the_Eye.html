    Keep in mind that Functional Generator is not ideal source of voltage with zero internal output impedance.
Our model of the Functional Generator can be setup to two values of the internal impedance:
50 Ohm and HIGH(>10 MOhm) by pressing SHIFT-OUTPUT and observing current setting in AMPL section appeared for 1 sec.
You should decide which value of the OUTPUT impedance will not impact your measurements and use it.
