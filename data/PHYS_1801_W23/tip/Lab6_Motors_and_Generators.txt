Motors and Generators, 

During this lab you will work in pairs and with your entire group.  Each group member must collect data for a different applied voltage, Va, to the motor.  Share your data with each other and then you can calculate the average resistance of the motor.

Ensure all cables are not touching the motor or generator in your experimental setup.

Do not exceed 8.0 V for the applied voltage, Va.
