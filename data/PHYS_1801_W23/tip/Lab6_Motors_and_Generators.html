<b>Motors and Generators</b> 

<p>During this lab you will work in pairs and with your entire group.  Each group member must collect data for a different applied voltage, Va, to the motor.  Share your data with each other and then you can calculate the average resistance of the motor.</p>

<p>Ensure all cables are not touching the motor or generator in your experimental setup.</p>

<p>Do not exceed 8.0 V for the applied voltage, Va. </p>
