Use the screwdriver to secure the wires to the SensorDAQ terminals.
Use the breadboard to connect the SensorDAQ terminals to the circuit on the board.
In Lab Activity 3 - you can decrease the temperature threshold from 30 to 25 degrees Celcius.

SensorDAQ terminal description:
6 -> +5V output
5,8 and/or 10 -> Ground (GND)
9 -> Analog Output 0 (AO0)
11 -> Analog Input 0 (AI0)
12 -> Analog Input 1 (AI1)

Ask the TA to check your work before moving on to the next lab activity!
