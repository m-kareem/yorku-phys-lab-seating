SUBMIT LAB REPORT BEFORE LEAVING. SUBMISSION LINK IS UNAVAILABLE AFTER THE LAB END TIME.

When finished, sign out but do NOT turn laptop off or shut the screen. ONLY sign out. Make sure you have submitted before signing out, as all files will be reset when you log out.
    
Make sure you leave the equipment as you found it, and notify TAs if anything is missing/broken/out of batteries.
    
To take a screenshot: Press window key + shift + S all at once, then drag to select the area to capture. This saves the screenshot to the clipboard, so you can now paste it into the excel file.
